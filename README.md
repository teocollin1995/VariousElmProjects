# ELM practice

This is just an exercise to learn Elm in preperation for exams on it. 

I've added conway's game of life a tool for randomly displaying 20 images in a grid at irregular intervals, named randomImages, and a crappy version of wacmole (as a simple way to make sure that I knew how to use buttons). I'm going to try to add markov chains, procedural map generation and maybe a neural net visualization? I'm not sure, but operation learn elm continues. 

Note: randomImages predates conway's game of life. It was the first thing that I ever wrote in elm. I decided to add it because history and I decided to add this comment so the commit record does not imply something other than the truth.
